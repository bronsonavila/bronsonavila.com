The following photos were taken from within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone in Ukraine on June 27, 2014. These photos predate the completion of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_New_Safe_Confinement">New Safe Confinement</a> (NSC), which now covers the original Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus constructed in 1986.
