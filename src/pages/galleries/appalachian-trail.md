The following photos were taken during the summer and fall of 2016 while backpacking 1,166.7 miles across the northern half of the Appalachian Trail⁠—from the summit of Mount Katahdin in Maine to the town of Harper's Ferry in West Virginia. The real star of the show is a hamster plush named Stumpy, which was a keepsake from my girlfriend. I sincerely thank the friends and family who lent a helping hand along the way, both at home and on the trail.
